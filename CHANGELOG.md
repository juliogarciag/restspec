- Added `:for` option to `schema` methods on the endpoint definition. This allows to specify schemas for payloads, schemas for responses and schemas for whatever. See: https://github.com/platanus/restspec/issues/2.
- Added `no_schema` method to endpoint definitions. This is a subtask of https://github.com/platanus/restspec/issues/2..
