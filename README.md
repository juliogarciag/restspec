# Restspec

Test any REST API using the power of Ruby and RSpec.

## Why?

Because testing an api can be hard, complex and ugly. We don't want hundreds of tests that depends on others and needs data from other places, disorderly placed or not so expressive. Tests, anyway, must help us to keep the house clean, not making it more ugly.

## Install

    $ gem install restspec
