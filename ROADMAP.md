# For 0.1 (First Release)
- Add tests for all the classes in the system.
- Add a folder called `examples` with two folders inside: one with an api and one with tests. Probably we should use Sinatra or some mini framework for this.
- Make a complete README.

# For 0.1.1
- Find a way to support a way of authentication based on cookies with an initial login.

# For 0.2 (They require more thoughts)
- Research pagination strategies and integrating them with `schema_id`.
- Research some way to generate markdown from a mix of the schemas and endpoints. (Like Apiary and others)
- Research ways to encapsulate the usage of change and not change in updates.
